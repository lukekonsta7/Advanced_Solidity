# Advanced_Solidity

I was unable to do the following on the Kovan testnet due to running out of test eth, I am unable to wait 24 hours to refill. I instead did the task on 'calhost 8545' using Ganache. I apologise for the inconvinence. 


# 1. Compile and deploy the PupperCoinSaleDeployer, confirm on metamask.

# 2. Confirm on Ganache to see if new block has been minted.
